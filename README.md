# JavaFX-Battle
A card game made with JavaFX based on the classic game of war
## What is this?
This is a card game made in JavaFX that I have named Battle. It is similar to the classic card game war where 2 players each take turns drawing from a deck and "battle"
with their drawn cards. Whoever has the higher card wins a point and the game goes on until all the cards have been drawn from the deck.
